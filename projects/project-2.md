I not only enjoy the challenges of coding, but the challenges of design as well. In my spare time I like to take on freelance design work. I mainy do product logos, product lables and event flyers. I have a also done bigger projects like magazines. My goal is to take the knowledge I have as a programmer and as a designer to make beautiful but also functional and user friendly apps and websites.

These are some of the designs I did for various companies that produce E-liquid nicotine. Being a freelance designer comes with many challenges. You go through many interation of designs just like you would with any coding project. There is also a challenege designing something thats right for your clients company. 

I learned that you have to be very active in sending out each iteration of your work so that the client gets the end result they envisioned. I also learned that working on many ideas loosely is good to start with. This is so that they can choose a direction they want to with. It's never a good idea to work too much on one idea at first because it might not be what they are looking for.
