This past week working with javascript has been interesting to say the least. It's been a few semesters where I had to use a language like this and that time has not been kind to me. I realized that I need start coding more for practice in my free time. The past few classes I've taken, have been classes that were mainly book work. I feel as if I have forgotten a lot of what I learned from those early java, c, and c++, classes. I find myself making a lot of little mistakes like missing semicolons at the end of statments.

As someone who didn't really code anything in quite a while, my thoughts on javascript is that I think it's a very interesting language. It's wild and loose and doesn't seem  to be as structed as java was. As I searched stackoverflow for answers to questions I had, I noticed that a lot of the answers could have quite the variations. Although javascript has many caveats, it's also very expressive and you can more or less run it while writing it. The feedback is quite immediate which is nice. 

As for the WOD's, this has to be the most intensely structured class I've been in apart from the time I was taking calculus 1 - 4. But what doesn't kill you only makes you stronger right? I like the idea of the WOD's to keep me coding and working throughout the week. When learning to code, you have to exercise your brain constantly or you'll lose it, just like any other muscle in the body. I feel like this class structure is the push I need for me to get it together. That's how I was able to do well in calculus, my professors seemed to be assigning unending work. But will I be able to succeed like in calculus? Only time will tell.
