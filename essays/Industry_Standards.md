You can find standards in any industry. They are this way because it has proven to work. I would not like to live in the world without standards. For example, would you rather live in a building is that built to a certain standard or one that is not? I would always choose the former indefinitely, and I hope you do too.

Just like buildings, programmers need a some kind of structure too. Only then will we be able to maintain what we write. Just like how building codes and regulations maintain the level of public safety. With ESlint I found it no harder to do than with other other standard I was told to follow for my other classes. The learning curve is not that steep and anyone should be able to pick it up. The consistency of being able to read someone elses code apart from mine when rules are followed is definitely needed. 

I noticed that adhering to specific qualifications for coding has made my past work more readable. Readable in a way that if I were to  come back old code I wrote in a few weeks or months, I would be able to work out whatâ€™s happening without needing to look at every line. I've developed a new understanding for the reason coding standards exist aftering having to work in groups with other people. I believe that the golden rule is that when you write code that is used by others, it is no longer yours. Doing things "your way" is a massive detrimental to the process.
