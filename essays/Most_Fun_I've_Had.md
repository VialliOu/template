It's been a really long time since I've found any of my classes enjoyable and fun, but this past week was different. It was the first time in a long time that I actually enjoyed the work I was given and didn't find it tedious because I was having such a good time learning the material and doing the work. This section on UI frameworks and the assignments on creating websites have reaffirmed for me that I want to do front end web development. 

I especially enjoyed the assignment where we had to recreate a website of our choosing. I spent more time on that assignment that I did any other for this class trying to perfect every detail, longer than I should have. I didn't get everything perfect, but I also didn't want to stop when I had trouble formatting some things on the page, like resizing 6 pictures inside a 6 column grid which wouldn't play nice. If I made the pictures too big, the grid would break to another row I was so determined to get it as close to the original site as I could. 

This assignment gave me an idea for something I want to do during the summer. I want to revamp and redesign as much websites as I can with everything I learned. I want to redo their corporate logo, change their layout, and much more. I think this will give me a lot of practice to see what works and what doesn't when trying to create things that user's interface with.
