I am working with Barry Abe on this project idea. 

## Overview:
The problem: Many college students don't know the location of vending machines and what they store. This means that many students end up making a commute in a search for their favorite snack all to be let down. Sometimes students do not even know the location of the nearest vending machine and visit what is familiar.

The solution: An app with the location of all vending machines and its inventory. 

## Mockup page ideas:
-Landing page.
-Admin home page.
-Campus Map / Vending Machine Location page.
-Vending Machine Inventory page.
-Search Item page.

## Use case ideas:
-User gets to landing page. Landing page has elements to get to search item page and campus map page. 
-Search Item page sends users to campus map page that shows vending machines with that item.
-Clicking on that vending machine bring you to the vending machine inventory page. 

## Beyond the basics:
-Map for locating vending machines.
-Database to keep track of inventory.
-Linking link page to database.
-Updating database to keep track of what is in the vending machine.
