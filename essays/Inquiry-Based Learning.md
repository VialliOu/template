In this day and age, the immediate access to information is wonderful. You can typically find what you need in a few clicks of the mouse. The answers you are seeking for is all right there on the internet. But how do you get to those answers? The first step would be asking the right questions. Without that you are stuck with an inadequate answers no matter where you look. There are tips you can follow that will increase the likelyhood you'll find a satisfactory answer. 

First and foremost, it is important you try to answer the question yourself first. Without this you will not be able to think about the problem and forumlate which questions need to be asked. If you have done this step and still haven't figured it out, your next move would probably be to ask another person. It is important to show that you've actually tried to attempt the problem yourself. In this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45670264/how-to-delete-every-third-element-as-a-loop-from-an-array"></i>example</a>, the first reply states that the original poster of the question has not even attempted the problem. His way he formated his question seemed like he wanted the answer spoon fed to him. 

In juxtaposition to the question above, this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45608362/android-studio-3-0-beta-1-failed-to-resolve-com-android-supportmultidex1-0-2"></i>example</a> shows us the correct way to ask questions. He tried the problem himself, stated what he did and how his own solutions did not solve his problem. As you can see, the first reply he got was far more useful than the first reply in the other example. He was able to get the correct solution to his problem in under an hour. 

Asking the correct questions is no harder than learning any skills. It takes a bit of practice but just like any other skill, but practice makes perfect. There are only a few simple steps which can be boiled down to investigate, experiment, discuss, and revise.
