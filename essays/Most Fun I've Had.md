My intrest in software engineering is mainly web development/design. I spend a lot of time online and I'm excited about it and what it can do, and I would to be able to contribute to that. Web sites and applications are a unique medium. What first attracted me to building websites was the ability to share what I created.

Whenever I come across a beautiful website, I always wondered to myself how it was made. I appericate the detail that goes into making something beautiful but also functional. Something where I don't need to click on 3 sperate things to get to where I want to go and doesn't have an horrendous user interface. 

I've always thought about how we as humans interact with the layout of webpages and the UI on apps. I have a small background in graphic design and I would like to apply that with the skills of a programmer. I want to build things that people not only use, but enjoy using. I love how web development/deisgn is a mix of art and science and I hope this class brings me a step closer to my goal.
